# Photolabs
This project, as part of Lighthouse Labs web development program, is a demonstration of React-based single-page application (SPA) that allows users to view photos in different contexts. API calls to a local backend populate both the photos being displayed and the topics that they are sorted under.

On the initial page load all photos will be displayed, individual photos can be selected and displayed in a  larger view in the modal.

Additionally photos can be 'liked' from anywhere in the app. Likes will persist throughout page navigation, and no matter what photos or topics are viewed.

To function properly the backend must be initialized as per the README instructions, then both backend and frontend servers must be running.
